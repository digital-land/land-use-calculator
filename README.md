# LUC

This is an app to test out possibilities for rendering and investigating home-cooked GeoTIFF files in the browser and provide estimated answers to knotty problems


## Developing

Once you've cloned this:
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
